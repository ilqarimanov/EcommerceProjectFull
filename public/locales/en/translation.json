    "text640" : "Headphone Specifications: Frequency Response: 15Hz-35kHz; Impedance: 32 Ohms; Sensitivity:100dB",
    "text641" : "Many loyal listeners know HiFiMAN for their planar-diaphragm, open-back headphones. While dynamic closed-back headphones are not typically produced by HiFi Man, the HE-R9s are an exception. I recently came to recognize HiFi MAN for its unique designs, clear/balanced sound, and present low end. After listening to HiFi MAN’s newest release, I came to realize that the HE-R9 draws elements from its predecessors despite its new design. Look and Feel - I would describe the HE-R9s as having an elegant appearance. The leather headband, steel framing, and red earcups give them a sharp, classic look. They are lightweight and easy to put on, yet still quite sturdy and don’t feel cheap. They could be described as simple in design yet still robust. I was surprised by the flexibility of the headband and soft fabric material in the earcups when I put them on initially. Their secure over-the-ear design blocks ambient noise effectively as well. Overall they are quite comfortable due to their soft material and lightweight design. I personally felt the cups begin to tighten a bit while listening for an extended period of time, as they aren’t a perfect fit for my ears. This was not detrimental to the listening experience overall, yet it's worth noting for those planning on wearing the R9’s for a specific number of hours. Headphone Specifications: Frequency Response: 15Hz-35kHz, Impedance: 32 Ohms, Sensitivity:100dB, Weight: 328g",

    "text653" : "When it comes to a large widescreen TV, no one would’ve suspected it to be as large as 219-inches. Of course, that isn’t surprising seeing as Samsung is the one behind the idea. With its smartphones already being dubbed as the greatest Android devices in the world, The Wall is just its latest concept piece that made its debut during CES 2019. What’s great about this behemoth is that it is made up of multiple panels while also sporting microLED, which is Samsung’s latest display technology. As it already dwarves its predecessor (which stands at 146-inches), The Wall is a modular TV, which means it can be expanded or downsized, depending on the situation. Its bezel-less display allows it to be more than just a conventional large widescreen TV; The Wall can also be used to display works of art when turned off, just one of the many features Samsung is proud of.",
